## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Starlight + Auth.js project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── docs/
│   │   └── config.ts
│   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── auth/[...path].astro
│   │   └── index.astro
│   ├── server/
│   │   └── index.ts
│   └── env.d.ts
├── astro.config.ts
├── auth.config.js
├── middleware.js
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

Authentication is configured in `auth.config.js`, and handled in `src/server/index.ts` for node deployments, or `middleware.js` for Vercel(/Netlify). Any on-demand `.astro` page may also access the session, like seen in `index.astro`.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
